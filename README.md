# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of Twitter tweets. 

## Data Preparation
The process starts with the necessary data preparation, involving data loading and preprocessing to ensure clean and relevant data for modeling. Below are the key steps involved:

- **Import Libraries and Download Data**: Using Pandas for data handling and NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
- **Load Dataset**: Data is loaded from a specified file path.
- **Preprocess Text**: Functions are defined and applied to preprocess text data by removing special characters, stop words, lowercasing, and tokenization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing the data to understand its structure and trends, which is critical for informed decision-making in model training.

- **Sentiment Distribution**: Analyze the balance or imbalance in sentiment classes using bar charts.
- **Word Clouds**: Generate word clouds to identify frequently used words in different sentiment categories.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib for more detailed statistical visualizations like box plots and heatmaps.

## Feature Extraction & Data Split
Feature extraction is crucial for converting text data into a numerical format that machine learning models can process.

- **TF-IDF**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is used to reflect the importance of words to documents.
- **Split Dataset**: The dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance objectively.

## Model Training & Tuning - SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and versatility with different kernels.

- **Configure SVM**: Set up with a linear kernel due to its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification.
- **Train Model**: The model is trained on the training dataset.
- **Model Tuning**: Adjust model parameters to improve performance.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics to understand its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

- **Performance Metrics**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to gauge the model's performance.
- **Classification Report**: Generate a detailed classification report to analyze the model's performance across different sentiment categories.
